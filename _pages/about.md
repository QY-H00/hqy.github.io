 I'm a year 1 PhD Student in School of Computing at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by Professor [Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). Prior to it, I received my Honours (Highest Distinction) Bachelor degree majoring in the same faculty. My research interest is to use computer vision to build connection between human being and aritifical intelligence, including pose estimation and deep neural network understanding.

Apart from research, I'm also interested in cutting-edge start-up and ventural captial. I founded company SmartNail working with [DingTalk](https://www.dingtalk.com/en) and [Forwe](https://www.forwe.vip/) to serve small / medium-sized construction enterprises with digital transformation solution. Prior to it, I was a Fellow working on the sector of AI and Metaverse in [MiraclePlus (former YC China)](https://www.miracleplus.com/en/).
